# Huffman Coding
This program shows some info about the greyscale BMP picture provided and then implements and shows the huffman codding on each of the colors that exists in the picture. Then, it would show the original and final number of bits of piture.

- You may need to update the diretory address of the greysale BMP piture on your own.
- Use C99 or higher versions of C comiler.

I should mention that I didn't develop this code but when I was looking for a code to show huffman coding on a picture, I didn't find a proper one, so I worked on the version proided by geeksforgeeks.com and finally got it run correctly!
